 flavor_germanics.1.t:0 "The Great Flood"
 flavor_germanics.1.desc:"Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."

 flavor_germanics.2.t:0 "Terp Settlement"
 flavor_germanics.2.desc:0 "The recent population boost has led to higher demand of habitable land. Some of our men have brought up to imitate the Frisian terp settlements, which they erected several centuries ago. Amsivaria's shore seems like a good place to pile up mud to create terps and build houses on top of these to protect them from the floods. We would need to send some of our men to help them, however."
 flavor_germanics.2.a:0 "Build such a settlement."
 flavor_germanics.2.b:0 "There are other more important matters."
 flavor_germanics.4.t:0 "Death of a Loved One"
 flavor_germanics.4.desc:0 "After the death of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName], people have tried to comfort me, but I never felt that they truly understood. Now I tend to avoid them and their idle chatter. However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a brown dog who has participated in the excarnation ritual of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName]'s body and shows similar behavior. Maybe the priest counseled me correctly and our loved ones truly live on in the dogs after an appropriate ceremony."
 flavor_germanics.4.a:0 "Pretty doggy, you understand me better than anyone."

 flavor_germanics.5.a:0 "I will bury him quietly."
 flavor_germanics.6.t:0 "The Sacred Grove of Mannus"
 flavor_germanics.6.desc:0 "Once again it is time, the sacrifice to Mannus will happen tonight. As always we are fettered, showing our submission to our great God. Luckily, no one fell down this time - a good omen. Last year the son of the shaman had to roll himself out on the floor, after he fell down. The past year brought us many storms and the harvest was bad. This was surely caused by the clumsy youth! \n\nThis year's sacrifice stands proud in the middle of the sacred ground, knife in her right hand. She has red hair, a rarity in our region. She also is most beautiful, her green eyes stand out especially. These traits make her the ideal sacrifice, for Mannus would be pleased with this gem of a woman. Already she holds the knife to her heart, the first droplets of blood dropping on the oak sapling beneath her. Her lifeblood will renew the forests and earth. To safeguard our communities and better our harvests, she willingly offers herself to Mannus. Now, she plunges the blade into her bosom, her last breath igniting the fire of life. \n\nAlready, the birds have begun to sing and rejoice, filling the void left by the girl's death."
 flavor_germanics.6.a:0 "Mannus, grant us strength!"
 flavor_germanics.6.b:0 "Oppose the ritual."

 flavor_germanics.7.desc:0 "The priest is riding Nerthus' wagon again, the time for war is over. The sword shall be replaced by the plough, the fertile earth seeded with grains. When nerthus visits our homes, there will be more children, the fertility of the women is grander than before. They all are blessed by Her voyage over the land, until she tires of it. Her first servant will follow his mistress to her domain in the ocean. There, the priest will encase the wagon again, after the slaves washed the wagon and ornated it with flowers and gold. Thereafter, the slaves are devoured by the ocean, the last sacrifice to Nerthus, until she wakes once more and blesses the lands with Her presence."

 flavor_germanics.8.desc:0 "Nehalennia, we thank you for a year of fertile soil, women and harvest. We thank your priest, who brought you to us many seasons ago. We thank you for the protection against evil spirits you garnt us. We thank your protection of the dead until they arrive in the afterlife. Your ship carries them all and brings the newborn to the wombs of the mothers. We thank you Nehelennia for hearing our pleas and we thank you for fulfilling them."
 flavor_germanics.8.a:0 "Nehelennia be praised!"
