 galatian_invasion.2.t:0 "Migration"
 galatian_invasion.2.desc:0 "The Celtic people that moved into Pannonia a few generations ago, have once again started migrating. They will soon be trespassing on the realms of the Macedonian Kings, whose cities are ripe for the taking, for the Diadochi and Epigenoi are are distracted and squabbling over the remains of Alexander's empire... \n Originally hailing from Gaul, these warrior tribes had settled in Pannonia and Illyria. Now the lands cannot feed them all, and they now wander the plains and hills in search of a new home. They are moving south and they have a record of plundering the cities they encounter. It would be prudent to prepare supplies for conflict, for we are not far from their path, and these peope might clash with the Hellenes. Since the hordes are so close to our homelands, we too might be dragged into the war."

 galatian_invasion.10.t:0 "Pella under Siege"
 galatian_invasion.10.desc:0 "My King, Pella has come under siege by the migrating hordes of the Gauls. In the past, these hordes never remained long in Greek lands, only looting and sacking their goal. Now however, they are driven by a need for new lands to settle, for Pannonia and Illyria are too small to support the descendants of the previous migration. We must assume that Pella would be sacked, but they would never settle there, since the Gauls know, that we'd evict them. Still, we cannot let the Palace of Philp and Alexander fall into Barbarian hands! How would they judge, seeing their legacy dishonoured so soon after they passed?"
 galatian_invasion.10.a:0 "We must relieve the City!"
 galatian_invasion.11.t:0 "Pella under Siege"
 galatian_invasion.11.desc:0 "The Galatians are besieging Pella, driven by the need for new lands to settle. The Macedonian King has called for assistance to purge this horde from Greek lands. We should aid him, for should the city fall, the path east would be free to threaten the our cities. Towards Thrace and Aeolia the hordes would march, plundering the weak cities in Asia Minor. The Gauls must be stopped immediately!"
 galatian_invasion.11.a:0 "We shall answer the King's call!"
 galatian_invasion.11.b:0 "He deserves his fate!"
 galatian_invasion.12.t:0 "Pella under Siege"
 galatian_invasion.12.desc:0 "Hordes of Gallic barbarians are besieging Pella. Should it fall, the path east and south would be free. The Tribes would invade Greece, Thrace and Asia Minor, an opportunity they would surely take. \n Originating from Rhaetia, Southern and Cisalpine Gaul, these tribes had settled in Pannonia and Illyria a few generations ago. They are now again on the move, looking for new lands to settle on. Their numbers have grown, for the lands of Pannonia and Illyria are fertile. Yet these lands are too small, driving them further south and east. We are too far to help, yet we should prepare for the worst."

 galatian_invasion.20.t:0 "Galatians have attacked Delphi"
 galatian_invasion.20.desc:0 "After battling their enemies to the north, the tribes have marched south. Sacking and plundering along their way, they have left a bloody trail through Thessaly. Now they stand before our Sanctuary to Apollo, their eyes filled with greed at all the plunder they dream of taking from our beloved city of Delphi.  Ares abhors the weak, so we will be strong. Athena guides the clever, with her blessing, our cunning will deceive the enemy. With Apollo's accuracy, our bows will find the hearts of our foes. With all the Gods on our side, how could we lose? We will not let these barbarians dishonour our holy shrine and city! We will defend it to the last, for the gods would not show mercy to the traitorous!"
 galatian_invasion.20.a:0 "Apollo is with us!"
 galatian_invasion.21.t:0 "Beleaguered Delphi"
 galatian_invasion.21.desc:0 "The tribes have moved south after they clashed in the fields of Emathia with the Macedonians. Pillaging on their way through Thessaly, they have now reached Delphi, which they besiege. They wish to plunder its riches, enslave its inhabitants and desecrate its shrine in honour of their heathen Gods. We cannot allow our Gods to be disappointed and betrayed. We must help our Hellenic brethren defend the Sanctuary of Apollo. Overconfident, they do not see the Greek cities as a threat. The Gods will favour us!"

 galatian_invasion.22.t:0 "Delphi besieged"
 galatian_invasion.22.desc:0 "Delphi is threteatend. The barbarian hordes have marched on Delphi, following their clashes with the Macedonians in the north, sacking the cities on their way south. Now, the Sanctuary of Apollo is beleaguered. The Pythia that made Delphi rich, has now made it into a target, for the heathens want to sacrifice her to their Gods. The riches that lay beneath her have attracted them, addling the barbarian's mind, their greed overtaking their minds. It would be a bitter sign from Apollo, should Delphi fall."

 galatian_invasion.30.desc:0 "The Galatians have sneaked into Anatolia, raiding, pillaging and looting some smaller towns. Now they arrive at Gordion and want to settle there, on the lands of our forefathers. We will not suffer them there, we have to kick the barbarians out of Phrygia. \n Hellenes of Anatolia unite, for you have nothing to lose but your land. The Gauls have invaded your farms, killed your sons and abducted your daughers. Hellenes of Phrygia, join the defense of Gordion. Victory will be assured, for the tribes are heathens and the Gods are on our side! We will not cede an inch. We will defend our homeland, and drive the brutish and barbaric Galatians home! \n \n - Excerpt from a rally speech in Gordion, orator unknown, around 60 years after Alexander's death."

 galatian_invasion.31.t:0 "The Gauls in Anatolia"
 galatian_invasion.31.desc:0 "Some tribes that besieged Pella have crossed over the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. They raided Asia Minor and sacked some smaller cities, yet they remained largely unnoticed. The Diadochi and Epigenoi are busy squabbling, and the smaller city states have to supply them. Thus, the Tribes meet no real resistance. The Gauls originally left Pannonia and Illyria to find a new homeland. Now, they have found the region they want to settle. Around Gordion, the land is fertile, the lands are hilly. The Galatians are accustomed to similar terrain, they know how to fight in it. Yet they will not be handed Phrygia on a silver tablet, for Gordion will be fiercely defended."

 galatian_invasion.34.desc:0 The Galatians have sent an emissary, they seek peace. They have come to us with an offer, which could be tempting indeed. In exchange for some land in Phrygia, they would serve as a vassal state. The Gallic warriors would fight for our cause, obey our commands. Should we turn their offer down, they would fight to the last man, their women and children having come along this migration. The war would be bloody and we would be forced to commit forces, that we need on other fronts. They propose this solution, for the barbarians know that we are distracted by other fronts; this, they believe, would be to our mutual benefit. \n We shouldn't forget that if we to cede the land now, we could still reconquer it later...
