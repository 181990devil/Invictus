 me_subject_independence.1.desc:0 "The popular opinion in our nation is clear: our fate is to be an independent one. However, how we go about this is still a very polarizing discussion. We need to agree internally first before deciding on a path.\n\nWe could try to intimidate [our_overlord.GetName] into releasing us. [random_left_advisor.GetName] has come forward as a leading figure for this argument. However this would entail serious agressive posturing, so when presenting our ultimatum, failure would definitely result in war.\n\nThere is always the diplomatic approach where we open a dialogue with [our_overlord.GetName] to try and reach a solution that would be beneficial for both. [random_right_advisor.GetName] looks to be the main proponent of this argument. Unfortunately, what would we do if [our_overlord.GetName] declines our proposal?"

 me_subject_independence.15.desc:0 "The Great Families in [unwilling_subject.GetName] have always had great wealth and influence. The fate of our nation has been shaped by the whims of their ancestors. It stands to reason that we need to make sure they support our current course of action. If we find ourselves in a war with [our_overlord.GetName], there can be no distractions. Surely we can offer them something for their loyalty?"
 me_subject_independence.15.a:0 "What do they want?"
 me_subject_independence.15.at:0 "You will start talks with the heads of important families in your nation.\nThey might ask you for something before pledging their unwavering loyalty."

 me_subject_independence.17.desc:0 "During your meeting with [selected_family_head.GetName], he suddenly stops you in the middle of your argument.\nLook [unwilling_subject.GetRuler.GetFirstName], he says. You can hold off on the practised speech. I only want fair compensation for my unwavering loyalty. It is very clear what kind of compensation he wants."
 me_subject_independence.17.a:0 "Give [selected_family_head.GetFirstName] the money."

 me_subject_independence.18.desc:0 "When you finished presenting your arguments to selected_family_head.GetName], he thinks quietly for a second.\nMy family could use some extra holdings to focus our attention on, he says.

 me_subject_independence.19.desc:0 "During the talk wth [selected_family_head.GetName], it becomes clear rather quickly he wants some titulary jobs for him and a couple of family members. They wouldn't have any actual power, but would gain prestige and a little influence from the titles."
 me_subject_independence.19.a:0 "Give [selected_family_head.GetName] those token titles."
 me_subject_independence.19.b:0 "That can't be allowed."

 me_subject_independence.20.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_5a$: An Unexpected Surprise"
 me_subject_independence.20.desc:0 "Before you can even start talking, [selected_family_head.GetName] interrupts you. You don't even have to persuade me [unwilling_subject.GetRuler.GetTitle]. Naturally you have my full support. A surprise to be sure."
 me_subject_independence.20.a:0 "...but a welcome one!"

 me_subject_independence.21.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_5a$: Talks Concluded"

We can't confirm the truth of these alledged actions, however it might be in our interest to start friendly relations with [unwilling_subject.GetName] when they would gain their independence. If a war of independence would come about, they will never forget if [tmp_ally_scope.GetAdjective] soldiers decide the outcome."
 me_subject_independence.26.desc_1:0 "\n\nThey even included a gift of money in their plea to convince us to aid them."
 me_subject_independence.26.a:0 "We must promise our assistance."

 me_subject_independence.26.b:0 "No aid will come from us."
 me_subject_independence.26.bt:0 "We leave them to their fate."

 me_subject_independence.27.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_6a$: Response"
 me_subject_independence.27.desc:0 "We've finally received word from [tmp_ally_scope.GetName]. They have decided to promise they'll join any independence wars we might start. This will help us in intimidating [our_overlord.GetName] to let us go without a fight. They will have to face [tmp_ally_scope.GetAdjective] swords otherwise..."
 me_subject_independence.27.a:0 "Praise the gods!"

 me_subject_independence.28.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_6a$: Response"
 me_subject_independence.28.desc:0 "We've finally received word from [tmp_ally_scope.GetName]. They have decided to stay out of any independence wars we might start.

 me_subject_independence.30.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_7a$"
 me_subject_independence.30.desc:0 "We need to prepare for any eventuality. The costs of preparing for this ultimatum are very taxing on our coffers and our populace. It might be prudent to ask for assistance."

 me_subject_independence.31.desc:0 "[selected_family_head.GetName] has begrudgingly accepted our request for a donation.

 me_subject_independence.35.desc:0 "After a bit of discussion with our [selected_high_priest.GetTitle] [selected_high_priest.GetName], he concludes that the gods must have blessed our path. We were surely prevail in our endeavours. This will increase our internal stability somewhat, but [selected_high_priest.GetFirstName] does not look happy to have been forced in this situation.
