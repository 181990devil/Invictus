 istrian_league_heritage_desc:0 "Herodotus and many others once thought the Ister ran its course through all of Europe, connecting the Euxinus to the Western Great Sea. While this is unfortunately far from the truth, the importance of the Ister cannot be understated as a railroad of trade into the inner tribal lands. And yet, not every tribe is particularly friendly - they are barbarians, and the Hellenic cities on the western Euxinus must prepare for anything."

 bosporan_league_heritage_desc:0 "The nations on the northern Euxinus coast have banded together to create a unified final front between the Hellenic world and the barbarian unknown beyond. Each city thrives as a result of the vast array of cereal fields at their disposal, but their job is a thankless one. They are seen by most Hellenes as being too barbarian themselves, having mixed with the tribal clans for too long."

 pontic_league_heritage_desc:0 "The Pontic colonies have lived rocky lives far away from their mother cities. Many of them have bordered the greatest and most diverse of empires, allowing citizens from all walks of life into their burgeoning agoras - this has made them a strong and tolerable bunch, as has their need to maintain a strong presence in the Bosporus in order to stabilize trade routes. Even though this makes them a cosmopolitan dream, their first citizens feel lost like foreigners in their own cities."
