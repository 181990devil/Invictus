trapezan_heritage_desc:0 "A Sinopian colony founded around 756BCE by Milesian traders, Trapezous was a cultural melting pot, originally home to several caucasian tribes, and was a trade gateway from the Pontos Euxinos into the Achaemenid Empire and the east at large. Fighting his way out of Anatolia, Xenophon recorded in his Anabasis that he and his 10,000 mercenaries got “provisions in Trapezus by purchase, for the Trapezuntians provided us a market, and in return for the honours they bestowed upon us and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we paid them like honours; if any of the barbarians were their friends, we kept our hands off them, while upon their enemies, against whom they would themselves lead us, we wrought all the harm we could” (5.5.14)."

Settled in the 6th century BCE by Sinopian colonists, this port town was also famously visited by Xenophon, as recorded in his Anabasis."
