 bactria_start: "#t Bactria#!\n\nBactria remains under the iron grip of the Seleukid Empire, which has become pre-occupied with numerous conflicts to the West, leaving its satrapy undefended from the hordes of Scythia. Bactria is wealthy, urbanized and fertile, and could become a great nation, if she can win her freedom."
 scythia_start: "#t Scythia#!\n\nScythia has been in great decline after king Ateas died at the hands of Philip II of Macedon. Despite shaky relations with the Greeks, some start to view their cities as pillars of strength and stability. Will Scythia change with the times or remain true to her nomadic way of life?"
 kush_start: "#t Kush#!\n\nThe people of Kush have all but faded into obscurity after the fall of the 25th dynasty. It is time to reverse the fortunes and grow to become the strongest Pharaoh the world has ever seen!"
 judea_start: "#t Judea#!\n\nFor centuries the Jews have been confined to Palestine and some corners of Arabia, their holy places and ancestral burial sites in the hands of usurpers. It is time to take back what belongs rightfully to the Hebrew people!"
 chola_start: "#t Chola#!\n\nThe Tamil Kings of Chola, Chera, and Pandya dominated the south of India during Maurya rule. Unstable and prone to warfare, the triumvirate has divided the Tamil people for too long. By uniting them under one rule, we shall take our place as the rightful rulers of Tamilakam"
