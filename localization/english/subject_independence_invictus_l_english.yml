However, how we go about this is a hotly contested topic that has led to polarizing discussions in our government. Before any dire action is taken, we must first agree on the path we must take.\n\nOne approach would be to secure sufficient resources in order to intimidate [our_overlord.GetName] into releasing us. [random_left_advisor.GetName] has come forward as a leading figure of this faction. However, as this would entail serious agressive posturing, any failed attempts at intimidation would  definitely result in war.\n\nOthers believe the diplomatic approach where we open a dialogue with [our_overlord.GetName] to try and reach a solution that would be beneficial for both nations.

 me_subject_independence.15.desc:0 "The Great Families in [unwilling_subject.GetName] have always had great wealth and influence in our realm. On several occassions, the fate of our nation has been shaped by the whims of their ancestors. It stands to reason that we need to make sure they support our current course of action. If we find ourselves in a war with [our_overlord.GetName], we can't afford to suffer dissent or infighting on the home front. Surely we can offer them something for their loyalty?"
 me_subject_independence.15.a:0 "We will offer what we can to sway them?"
 me_subject_independence.15.at:0 "Talks will begin with the heads of important families in your nation.\nThey might ask you for something before pledging their unwavering loyalty."

 me_subject_independence.18.desc:0 "After you finished presenting your arguments to [selected_family_head.GetName], he remains quiet and appears to be lost in thought for a moment.\nFinally, he says 'I'm prepared to offer you my family's support. However, it seems some of my family's holdings have been divied up and lost to us. We now find ourselves with too little to pass onto our children. Perhaps there are some state lands which could become available for us?' It's immediately clear to you that this was his price the moment he walked into the room."
 me_subject_independence.18.a:0 "Give [selected_family_head.GetFirstName] the holdings he is asking for."
 me_subject_independence.18.b:0 "That won't be possible."

 me_subject_independence.19.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_5a$: Minor Advisor Roles"
 me_subject_independence.19.desc:0 "During a discussion with [selected_family_head.GetName], it becomes clear rather quickly he wants some titulary jobs for himself and some of his family members. They wouldn't have any actual power, but would gain prestige and influence."
 me_subject_independence.19.a:0 "Let [selected_family_head.GetName] and his brood have those token titles."
 me_subject_independence.19.b:0 "Unfortunately, that can't be allowed."

 me_subject_independence.20.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_5a$: An Unexpected Surprise"

 me_subject_independence.25.desc:0 "Despite all the posturing and promises made in the past few months, the reality is we most likely can't do this by ourselves. It would be prudent to inquire with other nations if they would pledge their support. [tmp_ally_scope.GetName] would be a good candidate to approach."
 me_subject_independence.25.a:0 "We will have a better chance of winning them over with a gold tribute."

We know the truth of these alledged actions, however it might be in our interest to establish friendly relations with [unwilling_subject.GetName]. If a war of independence would come about, they will never forget if [tmp_ally_scope.GetAdjective] soldiers come to their aide."
 me_subject_independence.26.desc_1:0 "\n\nThey even included a gift of gold in their plea for assistance!"

They will have to face [tmp_ally_scope.GetAdjective] swords otherwise..."

 me_subject_independence.28.desc:0 "We've finally received word from [tmp_ally_scope.GetName]. They have decided to stay out of any independence wars we might start.

 me_subject_independence.30.t:0 "$gm_subject_independence_7a$"
 me_subject_independence.30.desc:0 "We need to prepare for any eventuality but the costs of preparing this ultimatum are very taxing on our coffers and our populace at large. It might be prudent to ask some important men for assistance."
