 #2. Fire breaks out
fire_events.2.t:0 "City on Fire"
fire_events.2.desc:0 "My #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetRulerTitle]#!, a fire has broken out in a bakery in #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#!. If we do not act soon, we may have to rebuild parts of it. /n Some of our ministers assure us that rebuilding the city would be less expensive than sending the fire brigade. They say, that a few slaves aren't worth our time. Others insist on helping the inhabitants of #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#!, arguing that it is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate our benevolence. Our subjects would be eternally grateful were we to rescue them."
fire_events.2.a:0 "We must help our Citizens!"
fire_events.2.b:0 "Let it Burn!"

 #3. Fire continues
fire_events.3.t:0 "The Fire is Spreading"
fire_events.3.desc:0 "The fire in #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#! has worsened and has encroached on the neighbouring buildings. We can still prevent further destruction if we allocate enough fire fighters and ressources immediately!"
fire_events.3.a:0 "Save the City!"
fire_events.3.b:0 "Who cares." #maybe add "...about a bunch of slaves"

 #4. Fire ravages...
fire_events.4.t:0 "Conflagration"
fire_events.4.desc:0 "The city of #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#! will soon be naught but ashes. Even the stone has melted; it is a ghastly spectacle. The fires burn, as if the Gods themselves were commanding them to. /n My #Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetRulerTitle]#!, now we can only pray for our citizens."
fire_events.4.a:0: "May the Gods have Mercy on their Souls."

 #5. The fire ends
fire_events.5.t:0 "The Fires Come to an End"
fire_events.5.desc:0 "The fires in #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#! have died down and the remnants are being inspected. Only some rubble, ashes and slag remain of the once proud city. /n What should we do now? We could rebuild the city, which would benefit us in the long term, but would necessite an investment. However, the priests say that the city was punished for its blasphemy by the Gods themselves, and thus it would be blasphemy if we were to restore the city."
fire_events.5.a:0 "The priests' are drivelling again."
fire_events.5.b:0 "The Gods must have punished #Y [SCOPE.GetCountry.GetProvince('en_fuego')]#!."
