 celtic_philosophy:1 "Celtic Traditions"
 celtic_philosophydesc:3 "The Barbarian Traditions encompass the fighting styles of the peoples of Hispania, Gaul, Britannia, and Germania, among others. They mostly relied on large formations of lightly armored infantry equipped with spears or swords, supported by nimble chariot formations or light cavalry, and made extensive use of ambush tactics, especially in forests.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Raise Levies#!'

 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Chariot Culture"
 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "The use of chariots in warfare stems back many thousands of years, and holds strong affiliations with nobility and class; chariot inhumations speak to the honor that can be won through battle. Chariots themselves were commonly used as mobile platforms with two to three occupants, from which javelins or other thrown weapons were used to break the ranks of their opponents."
 #Britannic
 celtic_britannic_path_1:0 "Scythed Chariots"
 celtic_britannic_path_1_desc:0 "Affixing scything blades to the wheels of our chariots, adds a lethal deterrent to anyone foolhardy enough to assault them."
 celtic_britannic_path_2:0 "Coming of Age"
 celtic_britannic_path_2_desc:0 "From a young age, our children are taught that they may be called upon to defend their settlements. If every man bears responsibility for arming himself, armies can be raised from the very salt of the earth."
 celtic_britannic_path_3:0 "Living off the Land"
 celtic_britannic_path_3_desc:0 "Our people know the ways of the land better than most; which berries and plants are edible, and which natural remedies can be used to salve wounds."
 celtic_britannic_path_4:0 "Word of Mouth"
 celtic_britannic_path_4_desc:0 "Whether it be a chance for glory, an opportunity for loot, or merely to revel in the slaughter, news of an imminent battle draws even the elders to our ranks."
 celtic_britannic_path_5:0 "Chariot Mastery"
 celtic_britannic_path_5_desc:0 "The terror inspired by a massed chariot attack, can be sufficient to break even the most battle-hardened formations."
 celtic_britannic_path_6:0 "Selective Breeding"
 celtic_britannic_path_6_desc:0 "Revered throughout the bronze age and before, as evident in the chalk hill carvings throughout Britain, the strong-backed domestic horse is a result of thousands of years of selective breeding, and capable of carrying a single rider into battle."
 celtic_britannic_path_7:0 "Take up Arms"
 celtic_britannic_path_7_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defense in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose, carnage."
 #Germanic
 celtic_germanic_path_1:0 "Strike and Withdraw"
 celtic_germanic_path_1_desc:0 "The relative fitness of our warriors, combined with our people's contempt for cumbersome equipment, allows us to outmaneuver traditional armies with ease. By harrying our opponents' flanks, they will likely lose enthusiasm for the fight before we do."
 celtic_germanic_path_2:0 "Natural Resources"
 celtic_germanic_path_2_desc:0 "The abundance of arable land and vast tracts of land sporting workable wood, give us unparalleled access to the resources we need to create weapons of war."
 celtic_germanic_path_3:0 "Ambush"
 celtic_germanic_path_3_desc:0 "'Quintili Vare, legiones redde!' - The battle of Teutoberg Forest was a decisive victory for the Germanic tribes, all but wiping out three entire Roman legions. While a combination of factors contributed to this, the Germanic familiarity with the dense terrain was a major one."
 celtic_germanic_path_4:0 "The Glory of the Hunt"
 celtic_germanic_path_4_desc:0 "Tribal warfare is a brutal affair. The seizure of slaves, women and valuables is a time-honored practice which we ought not to forgo."
 celtic_germanic_path_5:0 "Shield Wall"
 celtic_germanic_path_5_desc:0 "Germanic troops often surprised their opponents by utilizing a core of heavily shielded warriors, acting as a deterrent to attackers, and as a particularly cohesive and mobile unit on the battlefield."
 celtic_germanic_path_6:0 "The Young Must Serve"
 celtic_germanic_path_6_desc:0 "Learning the art of warfare is a vital part of every youth's education. If a child can wield a sword and maintain their equipment, then they are ready for war."
 celtic_germanic_path_7:0 "Hail of Stones"
 celtic_germanic_path_7_desc:0 "Those unable or unwilling to hold an axe, learn the art of the sling, or bow. A simple tool it may seem, but even mighty giants can be felled by a single stone."
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus:0 "Adaptability"
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers may be the fiercest the world has seen, but true humility comes in learning from our defeats.

 celtic_gallic_path_2:0 "Confederations"
 celtic_gallic_path_2_desc:0 "Many tribes maintained close relations with their neighbors, guaranteeing a certain amount of cooperation when it came to battle. Warbands likely comprised members of many different local tribes, all fighting for glory."
 celtic_gallic_path_3:0 "The Plains Fight With us"
 celtic_gallic_path_3_desc:0 "The rolling plains of Gaul, from the coast to the Alps, prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry."

 celtic_gallic_path_5:0 "A People on the Move"
 celtic_gallic_path_5_desc:0 "Our ancestors moved freely, uncaring of borders or territorial claims. These nomadic traditions live on, as our people live in constant readiness to seek out pastures greener than their own."
 celtic_gallic_path_6:0 "Strong Arm"
 celtic_gallic_path_6_desc:0 "While most of our warriors eschew the protection afforded by mail, our strong-armed and well equipped javelin-throwers clad themselves in armor, and can hurl iron-tipped spears capable of punching through plate armor, flesh, and bone."
 celtic_gallic_path_7:0 "Scale the Walls!"
 celtic_gallic_path_7_desc:1 "Our people have taken to residing in walled territories, which, while well-defended, have weaknesses, if one knows where to look."
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus:0 "Blow the Trumpet, in the New Moon!"
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Carnyx, a trumpet possessed of a harsh and instantly recognizable timbre, inspires our troops, while terrifying our opponents."

 #Seleucid
 greek_seleucid_path_1:0 "Agema"
 greek_seleucid_path_1_desc:0 "The Guard Cavalry formed a cadre of mounted warriors, who held the utmost respect and admiration for their King. It is said they are glad to lay down their lives in service of their overlord."
 greek_seleucid_path_2:0 "Arms for Hire"
 greek_seleucid_path_2_desc:1 "The Diadochi, despite, or perhaps due to their fractious bickering, were possessed of wealth beyond the dreams of most nascent monarchs. As such, mercenary cohorts were often available in the regions around these Greek despots."
 greek_seleucid_path_3:0 "Phoenician Sailors"
 greek_seleucid_path_3_desc:0 "The phoenicians forged an empire on the waves many centuries before Alexander's conquests. Encouraging their sailors to work for us is sure to give us an edge in naval warfare."
 greek_seleucid_path_4:0 "The Companion Cavalry"
 greek_seleucid_path_4_desc:0 "The Hetairoi were originally a Macedonian noble force, who pioneered the use of brute, shock charges. The Hetairoi were transplanted into various states, but retained their prestige as feared shock troops."
 greek_seleucid_path_5:0 "Kataphraktoi"
 greek_seleucid_path_5_desc:0 "Astride monstrous warhorses, and clad in near-impenetrable armor, the Cataphracts were an expensive form of cavalry, which excelled at punching through similarly heavy armor with their strong lances."
 greek_seleucid_path_6:0 "Thyreophoroi"
 greek_seleucid_path_6_desc:0 "These lightly armored infantry were recognizable by the Thureos, a distinctive manner of shield, and were amongst the most mobile of the Greek troops."
 greek_seleucid_path_7:0 "The Hipparchos"
 greek_seleucid_path_7_desc:0 "Often a charismatic and skilled general, a Hipparchos commanded a large unit of varying types of cavalry, often proscribing formational details down to a very fine degree."

 #Greek States/Macedonia
 greek_states_path_1:0 "The Sarissa"
 greek_states_path_1_desc:0 "Phalangites, armed with a buckler, and a spear known as a sarissa, made of the core of the late Greek phalanx. The superior range of the sarissa made getting close to this formation a particularly deadly task."
 greek_states_path_2:0 "Tarentine Advance"
 greek_states_path_2_desc:0 "The Tarentine cavalry, an elite group of mercenaries originating from Tarentum, utilized very unorthodox skirmishing tactics, which were adopted throughout the Hellenistic world."
 greek_states_path_3:0 "Siegecraft"
 greek_states_path_3_desc:0 "Nobody can claim to be masters of siegecraft as much as the Greeks. During the siege of Rhodes, and many years later in Thebes, vast siege towers known as Helepoli were deployed to attempt to bypass the formidable walls of these cities entirely. It is said that the Colossus of Rhodes itself was built using material from the abandoned siege engines of Demetrios."
 greek_states_path_4:0 "Military Colonies"
 greek_states_path_4_desc:0 "A time honored way of ensuring that loyal troops were available, and justly rewarded, plots of land were granted to native greek soldiers known as cleruchs, in return for their service in the military."
 greek_states_path_5:0 "Mine's Bigger Than Yours"
 greek_states_path_5_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, the Hellenistic kingdoms attempted to outdo one another with larger and larger ships. From the huge Quadrireme, a staple warship of Monophthalmos' navies; to the gargantuan Tesserakonteres, a dual-hulled monstrosity rumored to require a crew of at least 4000, the skills of the Greek shipwrights is unmatched throughout the Hellenistic world."
 greek_states_path_6:0 "City State Fortifications"
 greek_states_path_6_desc:0 "Centuries of infighting between Greek cities naturally resulted in the erection of numerous walls, towers and fortifications, designed to keep marauding armies at bay. The stonework required to develop such comprehensive structures is a testament to the master masons."

 #Antigonid
 greek_antigonid_path_1:0 "Veterans of the Great Campaign"

 greek_antigonid_path_4:0 "The Victor's Spoils"
 greek_antigonid_path_4_desc:1 "Cities during the early Hellenistic era would often spar over the slightest of insults. Due to such frequent battles, wars between states resulted in a style of warfare which yielded the lowest number of casualties, but highest number of prisoners. The victor would then keep them as slaves, or ransom them back to their opponents for a hefty fee."
 greek_antigonid_path_5:0 "Peltasts"
 greek_antigonid_path_5_desc:0 "Ostensibly used as skirmishing troops, the Thracian peltast was equipped with a small shield, and a series of javelins. Later, peltasts were sought after as mercenaries, by many warring states."
 greek_antigonid_path_6:0 "Specialist Infantry"
 greek_antigonid_path_6_desc:0 "Archery and the use of the sling was minor in the Hellenistic period, although the bespoke lead pellets employed by slingers acted as a formidable deterrent to enemy troops. Cretan archers were widely regarded as the best in their field."
 greek_antigonid_path_7:0 "Mastery of the Mountains"
 greek_antigonid_path_7_desc:0 "The soaring mountain ranges of central Greece have taught our people the fickle ways of doing battle in adverse terrain."

 #####Latin Traditions

 latin_philosophy:1 "Roman Traditions"
 latin_philosophydesc:3 "The Italic Traditions represent the focus on heavily armored and disciplined infantry found in the Etruscan, Roman and other Latin states. They came to favor the sword over the spear, and relied on quickly closing ground with and dispersing less well equipped infantry using strict formations, such as the Triplex Acies, with supporting light cavalry and skirmishers.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Triplex Acies#!'

 latin_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "The Walled City"
 latin_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Heavily fortified cities dotted the landscape of the Italian peninsula for generations. In Rome, the Servian wall looms high, built after the catastrophic sacking at the hands of Brennus the Gaul, and affording the inhabitants a small measure of peace from the strife to come."
 #Latin Tribal Path
 latin_tribal_path_1:0 "Artisanal Bronzework"
 latin_tribal_path_1_desc:0 "Even after the advent of iron-working, magnificent bronze shields, spears, and helmets of all kind, pour from the forges of nascent Italic civilizations. Even tribal cultures possessed a mixture of potent bronze and iron equipment, rendering them a fearsome sight to behold."
 latin_tribal_path_2:0 "The Equestrian Order"
 latin_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "In Rome, the equites constituted an entire sub-class of patricians; wealthy aristocracy whose holdings indicated their prestige. As such, the superior wealth and training of the equites afforded them the liability to serve in the exclusive cavalry contingent of the republic's forces. Elsewhere in the Italic world, warhorses were regarded as the domain of the elite, the horses themselves often being laid to rest alongside their earthly masters in the event of their death."
 latin_tribal_path_3:1 "Pietas"
 latin_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "Relying on the devoutness of their own soldiers, and that of their opponents, the Etruscan forces are reputed to have used their priestly orders to curse their foes in plain sight, causing them to rout. In any event, the peoples of ancient Italy left nothing to chance; proper obeisance was made to the gods, before each battle was made."
 latin_tribal_path_4:0 "The Acquisition of Wealth"
 latin_tribal_path_4_desc:0 "Italic tribal cultures, and the nascent Roman Republic all engaged in the practices of raiding, pillaging, and piracy, at times. From the mythical rape of the Sabine women, to the siege of Veii, instances of looting are present throughout the history of Italy."
 latin_tribal_path_5:0 "The Aulos"
 latin_tribal_path_5_desc:0 "Numerous musical instruments are depicted in Etruscan art, but none more mysterious than the Aulos. Originally a Greek invention, the signature double-reed and pipes would have been heard accompanying all manner of occasion, perhaps even lifting soldiers' spirits on the eve before battle."
 latin_tribal_path_6:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 latin_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The coast played a huge part in the economic life of Italy. Ships, and viable control over the locality, were vital for the continuation of prosperity in every nascent state. Skilled shipwrights, cheap labor, and abundant building material could be found in all Mediterranean harbors."
 latin_tribal_path_7:0 "Rousing Oratory"
 latin_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "The popularity of the Hellenic model of democracy spearheaded the empowerment of populist sentiment throughout a land hungry for rights. A skilled orator could sway entire cities in support of his or her cause, which could, at times, be useful."
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus:0 "Hill Dwellers"
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "From the Apennines to the Alps, hills and mountains were an ever-present feature of Italian life. It might be said that our armies are more accustomed than most, to the foot-slogging associated with fighting in adverse conditions."
 #Latin Support Path
 latin_support_path_1:0 "State Navy"
 latin_support_path_1_desc:0 "During the first Punic war, the Roman senate mandated the construction of a navy to rival that of their foe, the Carthaginian Empire. Modelled largely on the Carthaginian designs as well as sporting significant Greek influence, the enthusiasm for naval dominance continued throughout Rome's republican era."
 latin_support_path_2:0 "The Fabri"
 latin_support_path_2_desc:0 "The military engineers of the early Roman army were responsible for the design of military structures, as well as the logistical duties associated with organizing their construction."
 latin_support_path_3:0 "Scale the Walls"
 latin_support_path_3_desc:0 "Siege engines were scarcely used in the early Republic, sieges instead relying on covert attempts to scale the walls as well as sieges of attrition. During the siege of Veii, around 396 BC, the Roman engineers reputedly proved their worth by boring a great tunnel beneath the walls of the Etruscan city, breaking the siege once and for all."
 latin_support_path_4:0 "Castra"
 latin_support_path_4_desc:0 "Cohorts, and later legions, were adept at constructing temporary; and in many cases permanent, fortresses, which served as resupply depots, rallying points, or as bases to extend a zone of military control over an unpacified area."
 latin_support_path_5:0 "Logistics of State"
 latin_support_path_5_desc:0 "As the Roman military expanded, the practice of each soldier providing his own weapons became unsustainable. Thus, by instituting a chain of supply, from natural resources, to blacksmith, to the hands of her soldiers, Rome fueled her war machine with ease."
 latin_support_path_6:0 "Scutum"
 latin_support_path_6_desc:0 "Adopting the iconic shield, the scutum, alongside the development of the manipular system, gave Rome a decisive advantage over her local enemies. Subsequently, the scutum became almost a national icon for the Romans; the very presence of a Roman shield wall was often enough to win a battle before it started."
 latin_support_path_7:0 "Foederati"
 latin_support_path_7_desc:0 "Rome's primary source of cavalry in the mid-republic, had shifted from the equites to mercenaries and allied states. This allowed a diverse array of styles and abilities to be incorporated into the ever-growing Roman military."
 latin_support_path_end_bonus:0 "Rome, Ascendant"
 latin_support_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "After a great victory, Roman custom dictated that honor be paid to the responsible commander. Lavish celebrations, often encompassing athletic events, feasts, and processions, would occupy the city for days - reinforcing in friend and foe alike, the might of Rome."
 #Roman Path
 latin_roman_path_1:0 "Principes"
 latin_roman_path_1_desc:0 "Veteran warriors all, the wealthy Principes sported heavy armor, and fought in tight-knit maniples, making excellent line troops."
 latin_roman_path_end_bonus:0 "March of the Eagles"
 latin_roman_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Irrespective of victory or defeat, as long as the eagle stands proud, the spirit of Rome imbues all her sons."
 latin_roman_path_3:0 "Triarii"
 latin_roman_path_3_desc:0 "It is said that Rome's opponents know the end is near when the Triarii lead the charge. Often used to rout an already exhausted foe, the Triarii were equipped with huge spears known as hasta, capable of punching through light armor."
 latin_roman_path_4:0 "Roman Roads"
 latin_roman_path_4_desc:0 "Often credited with winning entire wars, the practice of using the military to build roads, both in peace time and in conflict, was literally world-shaping."
 latin_roman_path_5:0 "Professional Soldiers"
 latin_roman_path_5_desc:0 "The evolution of a levied fighting force into a professional standing army, paid dividends in terms of quality and expectation. The salaried soldier was much less likely to baulk at orders, or flee from combat."
 latin_roman_path_6:0 "Velites"
 latin_roman_path_6_desc:0 "Comprised predominantly of young, unproven soldiers, the velites were light troops which fell outside the standard army organisation, instead acting as mobile skirmishers. The Velites are said to have sought glory and recognition by their daredevil acts during battle."
 latin_roman_path_7:0 "The Honor of Service"
 latin_roman_path_7_desc:0 "As Rome grew in stature, military service became a matter of honor for young Roman men. Indeed, even after defeats as humiliating as the Battle of Cannae, in which up to 80,000 of Rome's soldiers were reportedly killed, the efforts of the senate were able to raise enough soldiers to take the places of the fallen."
 latin_roman_path_2:0 "Triplex Acies"
 latin_roman_path_2_desc:0 "The triple battle line was a manipular formation, primarily utilizing the Principes, Triarii and Hastati, with the Velites in freeform support. This highly flexible formation relied on the absolute discipline of each soldier, who had to know his place amidst the chaos of battle. In extreme circumstances, the Triplex was said to have reached over a mile long."

 #Mauryan
 mauryan_mauryas_path_1:0 "Versatile Infantry"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_1_desc:0 "Infantry in the Mauryan Empire were often equipped with a dazzling array of weaponry. Capable of acting as light troops one moment, to archers the next, allowed for unengaged linemen to offer ranged support in the blink of an eye."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_2:0 "Descendents of Airavata"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_2_desc:0 "Elephants had long been used for warfare by Indian states. Undomesticated, elephants tend to lead a peaceful, grazing lifestyle; however, when trained for war, the thick skinned colossi act as a living battering ram, breaking enemy infantry formations as a man might swat a fly."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_3:0 "Warhost of the Empire"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_3_desc:0 "Densely populated areas in northern India allowed for the recruitment of vast armies. The knowledge that every foot soldier is part of an invincible war-machine, inspires our troops to heroic acts of glory."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_4:0 "Natural Pathfinders"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_4_desc:0 "The overgrown jungles, and dense forests of India are perfect terrain for elephant cavalry. Able to part foliage with ease, the advantage this brings us in otherwise difficult terrain, cannot be overstated."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_5:0 "Dedicated Archers"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_5_desc:0 "The core troops of the Mauryan army were archers, armed with bows varying in style. Indeed, many Indian military formations reserve a place for a tightly packed group of well coordinated missile troops."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_6:0 "Homeland of our Fathers"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_6_desc:0 "The wild jungles and forests may have been what inspired the flexibility of the Mauryan infatrymen, who, in switching armament dependent on situation, could function just as well in low visibility, as in the open plains."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_7:0 "Integrating the Tribes"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_7_desc:0 "The systematic integration of tribal cultures into the highly efficient Mauryan bureaucracy was achieved largely by legislating them out of existence. The protection of forests, animals and royal grounds, effectively forced the tribal people to give up their nomadic way of life."

 mauryan_mauryas_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Used to dealing with the needs of huge armies, battles and sieges were often planned in great detail.

 #Coastal

 mauryan_coastal_path_1_desc:0 "The coast of India was a hotbed of commerce and gossip. The numerous natural harbors led to the establishment of permanent trading posts which dealt with local and foreign tradesmen alike.

 mauryan_coastal_path_2:0 "The Vyuha System"

 mauryan_coastal_path_5:0 "Flexible Divisions"
 mauryan_coastal_path_5_desc:0 "The organisation of the Mauryan army in particular, was built with flexibility in mind. The 'patti', the smallest constituent unit of troops, was unlike any other army in the world. Comprised of chariot, elephant, cavalry and infantry, it allowed for high tactical flexibility when performing formative maneuvers."
 mauryan_coastal_path_6:0 "City of the World's Desire"
 mauryan_coastal_path_6_desc:0 "Pataliputra, often considered the largest city in the ancient world, was the pinnacle of Indian architectural prowess. Elsewhere, the ability of Indian masons was displayed in the grand mountain fortifications, built to keep invaders at bay."
 mauryan_coastal_path_7:0 "State Artisans"

 mauryan_noble_path_2:0 "Trained to Kill"
 mauryan_noble_path_2_desc:0 "As well as providing an advantageous platform for a rider, war-elephants were trained to kill without a thought. An elephant charge was often enough to cause entire formations to panic."
 mauryan_noble_path_3:0 "Armored Archers"
 mauryan_noble_path_3_desc:0 "Many cultures associated archery with light, skirmishing troops. Not always so, in the Mauryan military; protecting archers against the projectiles of their enemy counterparts worked admirably in concert with the vyuha system protecting them against ground assault."
 mauryan_noble_path_4:0 "Padma Vyuha"
 mauryan_noble_path_4_desc:0 "The Padma Vyuha was a signature formation, said to resemble a lotus in bloom. The mythical origins of the Padma Vyuha are mentioned in the Maharabhata, however, the formation itself had only very limited uses."
 mauryan_noble_path_5:0 "Imported Horses"
 mauryan_noble_path_5_desc:0 "The trade in trained warhorses is vital to our success in mounted warfare. These sturdy creatures are capable of pulling enhanced weight, and are unlikely to panic in battle."

 north_african_naval_path_2:0 "Iberian Draft"
 north_african_naval_path_2_desc:0 "Carthage, in an attempt to counter the lack of available troops associated with their sprawling, decentralized empire, employed vast quantities of foreign soldiers. The fierce Iberians made a valuable addition to their ranks."
 north_african_naval_path_3:0 "Naval Dominance"
 north_african_naval_path_3_desc:0 "The Carthaginian fleet was a constant presence in the seas around Sicily and North Africa. The safety and reassurance this provides our crews cannot be understated, leading to a calm knowledge of our superiority in this theater."
 north_african_naval_path_4:0 "A Life at Sea"
 north_african_naval_path_4_desc:0 "While some nations build bespoke fleets for tackling particular enemies, our navy is in constant use. As such, our ships always carry supplies to perform maintenance in-situ, making it much easier to recover from combat or general attrition."
 north_african_naval_path_5:0 "Noble Warlords"
 north_african_naval_path_5_desc:0 "The noble heritage of our people lives on in our practice of appointing the elite to lead our men. Those with so much invested into our nation are hard to sway with offers of gold or land."
 north_african_naval_path_6:0 "Imposing Edifices"
 north_african_naval_path_6_desc:0 "The lighthouses, civic structures, and fortifications of our people are recognizable to all who enter our lands. The imposing walls of our cities, however, give pause for thought to those who enter with a mind for conquest."
 north_african_naval_path_7:0 "Putting our People to Work"
 north_african_naval_path_7_desc:0 "The reliance of the Carthaginian army on foreign soldiers, was not mirrored in the navy. The poor or disillusioned could always find cheap labor at sea, manning one of the many military vessels of the Carthaginian state."
 north_african_naval_path_end_bonus:0 "Maneuverability Above All"
 north_african_naval_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Greek penchant for huge ships was not shared by the Carthaginians. Experts in naval warfare, they favored smaller craft with enhanced adaptability, leading to numerous victories over their enemies. The Battle of Catana in 397 BC resulted in a crushing defeat for the Syracusan forces, who were outnumbered and outperformed by the Carthaginian armada."
 #Army
 north_african_army_path_1:0 "Skilled Recruiters"
 north_african_army_path_1_desc:0 "Unable to supply enough fit soldiers for the needs of the state, Carthage resorted to employing all manner of foreign mercenaries in their army. Relying on the skill of their negotiators, Carthage became the first port of call for soldiers seeking paid employment."
 north_african_army_path_2:0 "Professional Marines"
 north_african_army_path_2_desc:0 "Ships in the Carthaginian navy were outfitted not only with a crew of sailors, but a crew of battle-hardened marines. Boarding action was common in antiquity, and the presence of a cadre of armed men must surely have put the minds of sailors and oarsmen at rest."
 north_african_army_path_3:0 "The Sacred Band"
 north_african_army_path_3_desc:0 "Unlike the rest of the predominantly mercenary forces, the Sacred Band were a group of Carthaginian citizens, possibly of noble birth, armed and equipped with heavy armor and spears. This elite group operated in a similar style to the Greek phalanxes, but due to their small number, were destroyed and reformed on several occasions throughout Carthaginian history."
 north_african_army_path_4:0 "Uneasy Relations"
 north_african_army_path_4_desc:0 "The supply of troops to our armies by countries willing to pay, can have implications. Our nation could even be held to ransom by those unwilling to provide the necessary forces - this must not be permitted."
 north_african_army_path_5:0 "The African Elephant"
 north_african_army_path_5_desc:0 "Immense beasts with thick skin and a variable temperament, elephants were utilized as shock cavalry in the Carthaginian army. As proven by Hannibal's crossing of the alps, they made excellent pack animals when not engaged in combat."
 north_african_army_path_6:0 "Numidian Cavalry"
 north_african_army_path_6_desc:0 "The interior of Africa provides skilled riders, the likes of which our foes cannot match. Combined with our superior equipment, we can transform these nomadic warriors into fearsome heavy cavalry."
 north_african_army_path_7:0 "Devastating Charge"
 north_african_army_path_7_desc:0 "The psychological effect of elephants on the battlefield was huge. Battle lines would break, men were trampled, and entire armies would surrender at the dust clouds created by an approaching army with an elephant contingent."
 north_african_army_path_end_bonus:0 "A Hard Bargain"
 north_african_army_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Many nations were considered protectorates by Carthage, often providing troops in return for nominal protection. Whilst they were paid, this expectation of service drives down the costs compared with regular mercenary contracts."

 #Scythian Path

 persian_scythian_path_3:0 "Hit and Run"
 persian_scythian_path_3_desc:0 "Contrary to the formative tactics associated with infantry, cavalry tactics tended to involve much more individual autonomy. None more so than horse archers, who would create a swirling cloud of arrows and horses, demoralizing enemy formations, and giving an advantage to the subsequent pitched engagement."
 persian_scythian_path_4:0 "Cavalry Skirmish"
 persian_scythian_path_4_desc:0 "Cavalry make for excellent interceptors, cutting off routes of retreat, and interfering with supply lines. By ordering our riders to harass but never definitively engage, we deny our foes the convenience of a numerical advantage."
 persian_scythian_path_5:0 "Cataphracts"
 persian_scythian_path_5_desc:0 "Many cultures with a history of equine mastery developed usage of heavy cavalry, or cataphracts, as a means of countering small arms. With both horse and rider clad in heavy scale or mail, nothing short of total rout would break the charge of a unit of cataphracts."

 celt_iberian_path_c_2:0 "Pillage and Plunder"
 celt_iberian_path_c_2_desc:0 "Our lands are not as rich as others', so we are ready to raid for food and riches if necessary."

As punishment, the gods changed him and his wife into mountains. The Illyrians and Dacians mostly relied on large formations of lightly armoured infantry equipped primarily with swords, supported by light cavalry when available.

 illyrian_piracy_path_1:0 "Illyrian Pirates"
 illyrian_piracy_path_1_desc:0 "With Italia divided amongst rival states and much of Greece focused on conflicts to the east, the Adriatic is easy pickings for pirates sailing out of the many inlets of the Illyrian coast."
 illyrian_piracy_path_2:0 "Lightning Strikes"
 illyrian_piracy_path_2_desc:0 "When facing militarily superior foes, speed is crucial to preserving our forces and taking advantage of terrain."
 illyrian_path_1:0 "The Liburnian"
 illyrian_path_1_desc:0 "The ship that would eventually form the basis of the Roman navy was originally invented by the Illyrian tribe of the same name. Equipped with only one row of oars, one mast and one sail, it could not directly match the larger ships built by the Greeks, but the Illyrians' superior speed and maneuverability let them dominate the Adriatic nonetheless."
 illyrian_piracy_path_5:0 "Bold Sailors"
 illyrian_piracy_path_5_desc:0 "Harsh retaliation against any challenge to free reign of the Adriatic will make others think twice before interfering."
 illyrian_piracy_path_6:0 "Local Shipbuilding"
 illyrian_piracy_path_6_desc:0 "The Illyrian coast provides a swarth of inlets and harbours for shipbuilding, enabling local tribes to construct modest craft on their own initiative."
 illyrian_path_2:0 "Ship Binding"
 illyrian_path_2_desc:0 "A common Illyrian naval tactic was to tie their galleys together in groups of four and provoke hostile ships to ram them. This gave them the opportunity to board the enemy craft with a massive show of force."
 illyrian_path_3:0 "Drakoforos"
 illyrian_path_3_desc:0 "The drakoforos was a ship with a dragon's head mounted on the prow. By building larger and harder-hitting craft, we will be better able to defend our coasts from those who wish us harm."
 illyrian_path_4:0 "Illyrian Mercenaries"
 illyrian_path_4_desc:0 "The fierce fighting men of Illyria were in high demand as mercenaries. With such a glut of sellswords in the area, we should be able to hire them at a fair price."
 illyrian_path_5:0 "The Young Must Serve"
 illyrian_path_5_desc:0 "Learning the art of warfare is a vital part of every youth's education. If a child can wield a sword and maintain their equipment, then they are ready for war."
 illyrian_path_6:0 "Investing in Our Future"
 illyrian_path_6_desc:0 "Raiding and pillaging may bring us riches, but they are quickly spent. We must pour our new wealth back into our communities to strengthen them and ensure their growth."
 illyrian_path_7:0 "Mountain Homes"
 illyrian_path_7_desc:0 "We have bordered more powerful states for centuries, yet the mountains have always protected us from invasions and allowed our people to thrive."
 illyrian_path_8:0 "Dardanian Hoplites"
 illyrian_path_8_desc:0 "Trained by Spartan mercenaries, the Dardanians created hosts of hoplites that once terrorised the Molossians and Macedonians."
 illyrian_path_9:0 "Poised to Strike"
 illyrian_path_9_desc:0 "By the 2nd century BC, the phalanx fell into disuse as the Illyrians opted for small groups of faster-moving armoured troops. By placing more importance on agility and the element of surprise, they were able to defeat the close ranks of their Greek adversaries."

 # New Daco-Thracian Military Traditions
 thracian_path_1:0 "Falx and Sica"
 thracian_path_1_desc:0 "The falx and sica were curved bladed weapons. The edge of the blade was on the inward side of the curve, allowing warriors to strike at the arms and legs around their opponents' shields.  So effective were these weapons, that in later years the Dacian Wars resulted in changes to the standard armour of the Roman soldier."
 thracian_path_2:0 "Thracian Horsemanship"
 thracian_path_2_desc:0 "The cavalry of the Thracians was of particular renown, with Philipp II of Macedon adapting the wedge formation from them. In particular, the Getae in the north were said to be indistinguishable from the feared Scythians."
 thracian_path_3:0 "Tribal Kingdoms"
 thracian_path_3_desc:0 "The area north of Greece saw the emergence of many tribal kingdoms. When united under a strong king, they were a force to be reckoned with, yet such centralisation efforts often faced opposition from various local powerholders jealously guarding their ancient privileges."
 thracian_path_4:0 "Rugged Defence"
 thracian_path_4_desc:0 "The ability to use all our troops in the mountainous regions near our homes is vital to our survival."
 thracian_path_5:0 "Melting Pot"
 thracian_path_5_desc:0 "Throughout the years, the Dacians and Thracians came into contact with many foreign peoples, including Greek colonists, Gallic invaders and Germanic migrants. The native tribes quickly adapted the expertise brought by these foreigners for their own needs."
 thracian_path_6:0 "Colonies"
 thracian_path_6_desc:0 "As our population grows, let us learn from the Greeks to the south and found colonies across the landscape, rewarding veterans with landed property that they will eagerly fight to defend."
 thracian_path_7:0 "Peltasts"
 thracian_path_7_desc:0 "The tribes north of Macedon often shunned armor, which was restricted to nobles and kings. The Thracians in particular preferred to fight as peltasts, carrying javelins alongside a sword and a wicker shield called a pelte. Their great manoeuvrability allowed them to outrun the heavier Greek infantry, while also performing well in melee, unlike dedicated skirmishers."
 thracian_path_8:0 "Take up Arms"
 thracian_path_8_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 thracian_path_9:0 "Dava"
 thracian_path_9_desc:0 "These stone fortresses, built into the mountains, utilised concentric rings of defense allowing defenders to withdraw inward and continue fighting if the outer defences were breached."
 thracian_path_10:0 "The Plains Fight with Us"
 thracian_path_10_desc:0 "The rolling plains of Dacia prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry and fast-moving infantry."
 thracian_path_11:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 thracian_path_11_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defence in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose."
 thracian_path_12:0 "Tarabostes"
 thracian_path_12_desc:0 "Nobles played a very important role in the highly militarised Dacian society. Only Dacian aristocrats had the right to cover their heads and wore felt Phrygian caps. In battle, they might wear a bronze Phrygian helmet, iron scale armour and an oval wooden shield."
 thracian_path_13:0 "Offence Is the Best Defence"
 thracian_path_13_desc:0 "Many of our warriors do not even fight with shields, preferring instead to focus all their energy on relentlessly attacking the enemy."
