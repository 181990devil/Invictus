 flavor_germanics.1.desc:"Days of rain and thunderstorms made our people in [SCOPE.ger_1_target.GetName] fear that the end of days is upon us. However these didn't herald the end but a large flood that swallowed houses, animals and humans alike - all never destined to see the light of days again.\n\nAfter it was over, the survivors praised the gods but are now posed with the great challenge to rebuild what was once. The land still gets flooded twice a day, creating thousands of small islands completely surrounded by water, but the water is slowly receding...\n\nOur people are looking for us to set aside some of our funds to try and help those in need, to make the best out of the situation."

Now I tend to avoid them and their idle chatter. However, there is one soul whose company I have not loathed: a brown dog who has participated in the excarnation ritual of [SCOPE.sChar('rip_dead_dog').GetName]'s body and shows similar behavior.
