 embellish_suebi_grave_fields_desc:0 "Our druids have found the ideal place to build a Celtic metropolis at a crossroads between the Gauls to the west and the Boii to the east as well as the Germanics to the north and the Mediterranean world to the south. Circular ramparts will protect our oppidum from outside threats and the vicinity to the great Danuvius river will bolster trade even further."
