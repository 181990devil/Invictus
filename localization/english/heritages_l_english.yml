trapezan_heritage:0 "Trapezan Heritage"
trapezan_heritage_desc:0 "A Sinopian colony founded around 756BCE by Milesian traders, Trapezous was a cultural melting pot, originally home to several caucasian tribes, and was a trade gateway from the Pontos Euxinos into the Achaemenid Empire and the east at large. Fighting his way out of Anatolia, Xenophon recorded in his Anabasis that he and his 10,000 mercenaries got “provisions in Trapezus by purchase, for the Trapezuntians provided us a market, and in return for the honours they bestowed upon us and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we paid them like honours; if any of the barbarians were their friends, we kept our hands off them, while upon their enemies, against whom they would themselves lead us, we wrought all the harm we could” (5.5.14)."
kerasous_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kerasous"
kerasous_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly coming from the Greek: κερασός “cherry,” Pliny the Elder writes that the first cherry was exported from this colony town to Europe in Roman times by means of Sulla’s close friend Lucius Lucullus. Settled in the 6th century BCE by Sinopian colonists, this port town was also famously visited by Xenophon, as recorded in his Anabasis."
kos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kos"
kos_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the mythological autochthonous king Merops, Kos existed throughout ancient history as a place of wealth, learning, and luxury production. Freed from Persia’s grip following the Greco-Persian Wars (later only shortly ruled by the Carian satrapy for a while), the island remained largely independent around the great Aegean leagues, Alexander’s Empire, and the raging Diadochi, gaining a form of oligarchic self rule even while under the ‘ownership’ of the Ptolemies, who used it as a place for educating their dynasty. Kos also maintained a recognition for fine wine, a bevy of silk clothes, and the island’s famous Asclepion."
commagenian_heritage:0 "Commagenian Heritage"
commagenian_heritage_desc:0 "The region of Commagene, while its pre-Hellenistic age history is blurry, appears to have a long and continuous footnote in history stretching all the way back to its time as a Syro-Hittite kingdom referred to in the 15th century BCE as “Kummaha,” near identical with the later Archaic city of “Kummuh,” thought to be the same site/city as Hellenistic Samosata, where the Attic poet Lucian supposedly came from. Existing possibly as a satrap of the Armenian Kingdom before being a province under the Seleucids, the area boasts a multicultural demographic, being a melting pot for Hellenic and Iranian cultures, best seen in the royal sanctuary on Mount Nemrut."
bambyce_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Aramean Priest-Kings"
bambyce_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the famous temple for its patron deity: Atargatis, Bambyce’s history traces back to its annexation by the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BCE. Coinage suggests that it was ruled by Aramean priest-kings near the end of Achaemenid domination and transitioned to Seleucid monarchical governance following the collapse of Alexander’s Empire. The city prospered under the yoke of Macedonian/Seleucid rule, becoming ‘the place’ to stop at between Antioch and Selucia on the Tigris, eventually becoming the richest city in Roman Syria."
olbe_cilicia_heritage:0 "Olban Heritage"
olbe_cilicia_heritage_desc:0 "The only independent Cilician Kingdom, Olbe was supposedly founded by Ajax, son of Teucer. It became a pirate’s haven after the ruling dynastic priests of Cilicia Tracheia fell to chaotic, short-lived tyrants and fell further into disarray after those. These Cilician pirates would later reappear in notable records during the Servile Wars, offering Spartacus a chance to cross from mainland Italy into Sicily before taking his money and leaving him and his army stranded."
laranda_heritage:0 "Larandan Heritage"
laranda_heritage_desc:0 "The greatest marauders from eastern Anatolia, the Lycaonians of Laranda lost much of their glory following the invasions of the Makedonian empire and the following infighting between the diadochi rulers - notably, Perdiccas destroyed the settlement in 322 BCE, after which habitation gradually resumed."
kotyora_heritage:0 "Kotyoran Heritage"
kotyora_heritage_desc:0 "A colony founded by Milesians from Sinope, this town was a resting point for Xenophon and his 10,000 mercenaries, who rested there for 45 days. Speaking to Sinopian diplomats about the native Kotyorites in his Anabasis, he writes: they did not behave toward us as friends, but shut their gates and would neither admit us within nor send a market without; and they alleged that the governor set over them by you was responsible for this conduct."
amisos_heritage:0 "Amison Heritage"
amisos_heritage_desc:0 "Established by Ionian Milesians between 760 and 750BCE, this town is notable for two things: the early wild goat style pottery found in archaeological excavations, and the fact that the area is, according to the Greek historian Hecataeus, the site of the previously known Enete - home of the paphlagonian Enetoi who’s king Plyaemenes was an ally of the Trojans in the fabled war."
sinope_heritage:0 "Heritage of Autolycus"
sinope_heritage_desc:0 "Namesake of the red earth pigment ‘sinopia,’ the colony of Sinope traces its lineage to both Miletian colonists and the legendary Autolycus, grandfather of both Jason of the Argonauts and the wandering Odysseus. A colony itself, Sinope expanded to found its own colonies along the coast of the Pontos Euxinos, creating a hub of trade between the many Greek cities, outposts, and emporioi."
paphlagonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pylaemenes"
paphlagonia_heritage_desc:0 "One of the oldest tribes in Anatolia and established in myth as having been strong allies of the Trojan defenders in the 10-year war, the paphlagonians were in those ancient times ruled by the king Pylaemenes - may of his successors have payed tribute to his revered reign and legacy by taking on his name as their own, wearing the title: “Pylaemenes”. This tribe would soon spawn the line of Mithridates following the fall of Alexander’s Empire, one of the staunchest thorns in the Roman Republic’s side."
kaukonia_heritage:0 "Kaukonian Heritage"
kaukonia_heritage_desc:0 "It is hard to say where the Kaukones came from, or where they went. Some, like Homer, consider them an autochthonous group in Anatolia, while others consider the name to be referring to a Greek tribe, or a tribe having moved into Greece. For all intent and purposes, the Iliadic reference to Kaukones is used, and so they can say they were part of the great Trojan War - huzzah!"
sesamos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Amastris"
sesamos_heritage_desc:0 "While Sesamos was its own Ionian colony, as outlined in a reference in the Iliad, its was supposedly joined with other cities in order to create the grand city/territory of Amastris, named after the same Amastris who was the wife of Darius III of Persia, Dionysius of Heraclea, and Lysimachus. The site of Sesamos then became the center of and housed the acropolis of the new Amastris following the woman’s separation from Lysimachus."
tieion_heritage:0 "Heritage of Philetairos"
tieion_heritage_desc:0 "The colony of Tieion, founded in the 7th century BCE, was the birthplace of Philetaerus and Pergamon’s royal dynasty. A eunuch all his life (a crowd supposedly crushed his genitals), he served under Antigonos, Lysimachus, and Seleucus during the Diadochi Wars before finding independence in Pergamon and establishing the reign of the Attalid dynasty."
mariandynia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mariandynus"
mariandynia_heritage_desc:0 "A tribe sometimes described akin to the neighboring Bithyni, and sometimes described akin to the Paphlagonians, the Mariandyni have lived in forced servitude of several peoples, including those living in Heraclea Pontica. But all of these can trace their lineage back to Aeolian Mariandynus and his grandson of the same name - the composer of mourning songs."
calchedon_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Blind"
calchedon_heritage_desc:0 "A Megaran colony founded in 685BCE, the its founders must have been cursed by the gods to be so blind as to not found their colony on the far superior other side of the Bosporus Straight (where Byzantion was built). Both Greeks (Athenians) and Persian Megabuzus said as much of them. Yet the city experienced a wealth of trade and built many temples to the gods. Blind luck."
astakos_heritage:0 "Astakan Heritage"
astakos_heritage_desc:0 "A Megaran colony established in the 8th century BCE, also supposedly founded by the legendary Astakos, son of Poseidon and the nymph Olbia, this city’s greatest legacy would be in its destruction by the Bithynian king Zipoetes I in 301 BCE and the founding of a new city in its place: Nicomedia, future Eastern Roman capital under Diocletian, named after Nicomedes I, Zipoetes’ son."
kyzikos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Kyzikenus"
kyzikos_heritage_desc:0 "Known best for its kyzikenus (coin), the city’s gold stater worth 28 drachma, Kyzikos was a prospering colony city following the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War and the decline of both Miletus and Athens. This city is also where the philosopher Eudoxus of Knidos established his school in the 4th century BCE."
