 cyr_magas_01.1.t: "A New Governor for Cyrenaica"
 cyr_magas_01.1.desc: "Formally part of Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greek colonies of Cyrenaica have been in disarray ever since the previous Ptolemaic governor was killed by his Syracusan allies during a failed invasion of Carthage in 444 AUC (309 BCE). As a new official governor hasn't been appointed yet, a group of local Greek elites currently remains in control of the country. \n\nFor now the gaze of our Egyptian overlords is locked firmly on their rivals in the east, but it is only a question of time until the Ptolemies will appoint a new governor for our region. And once they do they will likely demand closer integration with Egypt. \n\nMaybe we could ensure Egypt of our continued loyalty by approaching them to request a new governor before they make a decision on the matter. This might also allow us to maintain a greater degree of independence than other Egyptian holdings…  "

Berenike herself is the grand-nice of the former Macedonian regent [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetFullName] and a distant relative of Alexander the Great, making her a women of exceptionally high status even before her marriage to Ptolemaios.  \n\nBetween the military talents of his father and the heritage and political connections of his mother, Magas will allow Cyrenaica to play an important role in the wars over Alexander's legacy."

 cyr_magas_01.12.desc: "Influenced by the teachings of Buddhist missionaries, [death_persuader.GetName], a prominent philospher of the Cyrenaic School, has produced a particularly radical form of Cyrenaic philosophy. Like other Cyrenaic philosopher he believes that achieving happiness is the only purpose of life, and that anything that doesn't result in greater happiness is fundamentally meaningless. [death_persuader.GetName] goes further however by arguing that true happiness is unachievable in life, and that life itself is thus meaningless - even going so far as to claim that 'The sage man is indifferent between life and death.'. \n\n[death_persuader.GetName] has collected his teachings in a book called 'Death by Starvation'.

 cyr_academies_01.2.t: "The Future of Cyrenaic Philosophy"
 cyr_academies_01.2.desc: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] is home to the famous philosphical school of the Cyrenaics. The school itself was founded by #Y Aristippus the Elder#! during the time of Socrates, however many of his teaching were formalized only by [GetCharacter('(int32)233').GetName], called 'Metrodidaktos' ('Mother-Taught') since he learned philosophy from his mother (Arete, daughter of Aristippus the Elder). \n\nCyrenaicism is a hedonistic school of philosophy that emphasizes individual pleasure as the highest goal of human life. Other values such as a virtuous life are only valued to the extent and that they can increase the individual's pleasure or` decrease the individual suffering. \n\nRecently however, the popularity of Cyrenaicism has been in decline, largely due to the rise of new, non-Cyrenaic hedonistic philosophers such as [GetCharacter('(int32)218').GetName] whose ideas are more refined than those of Aristippus. In response a new generation of Cyrenaic philosophers has emerged who are trying to update the Cyrenaic school to allow it to compete with the other philosophical schools of the day. Of particular note are the teachings of [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName], [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName] and [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetName]. \n\nLike other Cyrenaics [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetName] considers pleasure the ultimate goal of life, unlike Aristippus however he believes that pleasure needs to be consider for each action individually (rather than as the total pleasure accrued over ones lifetime), and that suffering is not the opposite of pleasure. Thus for [GetCharacter('(int32)446').GetFirstName] virtues such as friendship, loyalty and patriotism can be good as they bring pleasure in the moment, even if they may occasionally cause pain and suffering in the long run. \n\n[GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetName] too shares the common Cyrenaic belief in pleasure as the ultimate goal of life. However he openly rejects  friendship and patriotism as distractions from the pursuit of happiness, instead insisting that 'the world is his country'. In fact, [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName] believes that there is nothing inherently wrong with crimes such as theft and adultery - they are to be avoided only because the punishments society imposes in return cause suffering (and thus reduce pleasure). However [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName]'' most controversial claim by far is his insistence that the gods – or at least the commonly accepted gods of the Hellenistic world – are false and that gods, prayer, sacrifices and sacrilege are all just human inventions. His insistance that the gods don't exist has earned [GetCharacter('(int32)230').GetFirstName] the nickname 'Atheus' ('The Atheist'). \n\n[GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetName] likewise sees happiness as the highest goal of life. Unlike the other two however, he believes that it is fundamentally impossible to achieve true happiness. Furthermore [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetFirstName] believes it is impossible to truly understand another man's experiences. Thus to him there is no difference between live as a king and live as a slave: Neither can know true happiness, both are forced to experience suffering, and neither can compare himself to the other because they cannot know the other's experiences. Thus, instead of maximising pleasure, for [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetFirstName] life is about minimizing personal suffering - and for [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetFirstName] there is no better way to reduce suffering then death. This is [GetCharacter('(int32)445').GetFirstName]'s boldest claim: That death is preferable to life, for in death there is no suffering.

 cyrene_1_magas_DESCRIPTION: "The lands of Cyrenaica form an oasis of lush plains and verdant forests amidst the unforgiving sands of the Libyan Dessert. \n\nIt was this wealth of resources which three hundred years ago, attracted Greek settlers from the island of Thera who founded the five cities of Cyrenaica: Cyrene, Taucheira, Euesperides, Belagrae and Barce. These five cities gave Cyrenaica it's two names, Pentapolis "The Five Cities" or Cyrenaica "The Lands of Cyrene" after the most important of the five. The commander of the group that founded Cyrene took the local Libyan name Battus, and his descendants would reign as Kings of Cyrenaica until the Kingdom's fall to the expanding Persian Empire. \n\nUnder the rule of the Battids the young colonies of Colonies of Cyrenaica grew to be one of the most important centres of learning in the Greek world, it's medical school and philosophical academy at times rivalling Athens itself. The flurishing trade with Crete and the Greek cities on the Peleponnese brought with it not only much wealth, but also a growing number of new settlers from all over the Greek world. \n\nSoon however, tensions between the original settlers from Thera, other Greeks, and the local Libyans began to grow. And thus, around the year 200 AUC (~550 BCE) the then king of Cyrenaica, Battus III, in an attempt to stabilise his realm instituted constitutional reforms which greatly limited the authority of the king in favour of an elected senate. Battus III's heirs greatly resented this move towards republicanism until, following a series of civil wars and the eventual murder of his father Arcesilaus III, the grandson of Battus III, Battus IV, invited in the armies of Persia in order to secure his old rights. \n\nSubmission to the Persians however would not save the Battid dynasty. In the year 313 AUC (440 BCE) Battus IV's successor, Arcesilaus IV would likewise be murdered by his own citizens, to be replaced this time not by another Battid ruler, but by a governor appointed by the Persian Emperor. \n\nThus the Kingdom of Cyrenaica came to an end, replaced first by Persian rule and then by submission to its conquerors, Alexander the Great and ultimately his successor in Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter. Ptolemy put Cyrenaica into the hands of Ophellas, a veteran of Alexander's Indian campaign. Ophellas however was killed when he was betrayed by his own allies during an invasion of Carthage. The death of Ophellas has left Cyrenaica without an official ruler, formally still part of Egypt but de facto independent. This situation however is unlikely to last for long - it is certain that the Ptolemies will appoint a new governor sooner rather than later. "

 cyrene_1_reform: "Politics of the Pentapolis"
 cyrene_1_reform_DESCRIPTION: "After centuries of having their rulers imposed by the command of far-off kings, the Greek cities of Cyrenaica finally  have a king of their own once again.  However, the new monarchs of Cyrenaica are themselves foreigners who took the throne of Kyrene with the help of their army of Macedonians. In the eyes of many Cyrenaicans this makes them little different from the string of foreign rulers that came before them. \n\nIf the current rulers want to hold onto their power, they will have to legitimise their rule in the eyes of their citizens; either by embracing local customs and drawing upon the memories of the pre-Persian Kingdom of Cyrenaica, or by establishing themselves as Hellenistic kings in the fashion of the Seleucids and Ptolemies. Otherwise, they may soon find themselves replaced by a more inclusive form of government. "
 cyrene_1_reform_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered completed when Cyrenaica has reformed its government philosophy."
 cyrene_1_reform_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Reform the CYrenaican Government"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_1: "The Dawn of a New Age"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_1_DESC: "The first Kingdom of Cyrenaica that was founded by Battus I and his Theran colonist came to an end when it tore itself apart over how much power the royal family should wield. Now that a new dynasty has taken the Battiad's place Cyrenaica is once again at a crossroad: Will the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamily.GetName]s consilidate their power and rule as absolute kings, or will they buy their subjects trust by share some of their power with their lesser? If they might even see themselves replaced entirely..."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_2: "Touring the Five Cities"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_2_DESC: "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] may be the undisputed ruler of Cyrenaica, but many of its people know little more about him than his name. An extensive tour of the Cyrenaican countryside could make sure that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s subjects recognise him as the true king."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_3: "The Last Battiads"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_3_DESC: "More than 300 years ago Battus I led a group of settlers from the Aegean Island of [GetProvince('(int32)454').GetName] to the coast of Libya where the founded the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName]. Battus would become the first king of Cyrenaica, and the dynasty he founded, the Battiads, would continue to rule for two centuries before succumbing to a combination of internal unrest and Persian expansionism. Though the Battiads have lost the kingship, many of their descendants continue to hold important positions..."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_4: "Empower Local Assemblies"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_4_DESC: "Each city in Cyrenaica has its own local assembly that decide on matters too unimportant - or too urgent - to bring to the king. Many in Cyrenaica are demanding that the powers of these assemblies be expanded and formalised. However this could set a very dangerous precedent..."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_5: "The Three Tribes of Cyrenaica"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_5_DESC: "A long time ago the Greek lawmaker Demonax divided the citizens of Cyrenaica into three tribes: Greeks from the island of Thera, Greeks from the Peloponnese and Crete, and Greeks from the other Aegean islands. At the time this was effective in quelling the unrest that had gripped Cyrenaica. Reviving this ancient rule could help us better organise the diverse people living within our borders."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_6: "Embellish the Pentapolis"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_6_DESC: "Cyrenaica is famous for its five cities: Kyrene, Barke, Taucheira, Euesperides and Apollonia. Since Kyrene is the seat of the Cyrenaican monarchy, the other four cities have at times been somewhat neglected. A major investment into those cities would be seen as strong sign of royal benevolence, though it would mean putting considerable resources into places that are not directly under royal control."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_7: "Mint Royal Coinage"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_7_DESC: "It is tradition for kings to start minting coins with their image after ascending the throne. This not only makes the coins more difficult to counterfeit, but it also fulfills the very important function of making the king appear present in his subjects everyday life. "
 cyrene_1_reform_task_8: "Expand the Royal City"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_8_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] is the oldest city in Cyrenaica and has long been the centre of royal power in Cyrenaica. This has made [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] virtually synonymous with the power of the king. A series of grand construction projects in [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName] would reflect directly on the splendour of the monarchy."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_9: "A Coastal Powerbase"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_9_DESC: "The authority of [GetProvince('(int32)3360').GetName]'s new Hellenistic rulers is strongest along the coast where ships can connect Cyrenaica with the Greek homeland. However several of Cyrenaica's traditional power centres are far from the coast on the fertile plateau to borders the Libyan desert. A series of new cities could move Cyrenaica's economic centre closer to the coast where it would be easier for us to control." 
 cyrene_1_reform_task_10: "Form a Royal Army"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_10_DESC: "Alexander's successors rule by the authority of their personal armies. If [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had a personal army of his own it would be considerably more difficult for other to challenge his authority."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_11: "Expel the Foreign Kings"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_11_DESC: "The time for Kings and tyrants is over. Cyrenaica will throw of the shackles of monarchy and return power to its citizens! ... At least to those worthy of wielding it."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_12: "Demonax's Vision"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_12_DESC: "During the waning days of the first kingdom of Cyrenaica the great lawmaker Demonax wrote a constitution for Cyrenaica. Under Demonaxes rules the power of the monarchy was strictly curtailed to the extend that the king became little more than a figurehead. Clearly Demonax had the right idea - it is time we reinstate his constitution."
 cyrene_1_reform_task_13: "The Renewed Kingdom"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_13_DESC: "For a hundred years the kings of Cyrenaica ruled with absolute authority, and while they did Cyrenaica stood strong and independent. It was only after its fifth king, Battus III, surrendered much of his power to his lessers that the kingdom became consumed by internal strife; eventually leading to its annexation by the Persians. We will not repeat the mistakes of Battus III, the Cyrenaican king must rule with absolute authority!"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_14: "A Diadochi King"
 cyrene_1_reform_task_14_DESC: "While [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] may rule over CYrenaica, he is one of Alexanders successors first and foremost.
