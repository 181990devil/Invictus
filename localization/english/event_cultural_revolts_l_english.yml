cultural_annexed_revolt.2.t:0 "A proud people resist us"
cultural_annexed_revolt.2.desc:0 "The recent conquest of the [target_annexed_culture.GetCulture.GetName] lands has brought us much wealth and vast lands, but the proud people who ruled there are resentful of their relegation to the rank of mere constituents and the resulting loss of status. This sense of injustice led to much unrest in the newly conquered territories. \nShowing understanding will ease tensions, but shouldn't we show that our dominance is unquestionable? "

cultural_revolt_event.2.desc:0 "Whispers in the dark corners when our soldiers pass and repeated insubordination... What was only a passing incident becomes the norm in the territories of the [target_revolted_culture.GetCulture.GetName] people.\nIt would seem that being treated as second class citizens is not to the liking of this proud people.\n Nothing problematic yet, but these troubles could become major if taken lightly. However, these signs could also be interpreted as the meaningless gesticulations of a culture destined to disappear."

A diplomatic approach would help calm tensions, but is the posturing of a few peasants really worth it?"
cultural_revolt_inv.4.a:0 "Protests always fade with time anyway..."
cultural_revolt_inv.4.a.tt1:0 "No action will be taken."

cultural_revolt_inv.4.b.tt1:0 "We will try to establish contact with the troublemakers to find a solution"
cultural_revolt_inv.4.b.tt2:0 "We manage to establish a dialogue...\n High @oratory_icon! Charisma or the traits #G Silver Tongued#!, #G Prominent#! or #G Assertive#! will increase the chances of success."
cultural_revolt_inv.4.b.tt3:0 "Contact will be established, but they will present exigences"
