### MISSIONS
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance:0 "Our Stance on the Greeks"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "The Hellenic republics on the Pontos Euxinus must adapt to survive."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_BUTTON_DETAILS:0 ""
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_DESCRIPTION:0 "Our people have experienced a great period of decline after the death of the late king Ateas at the hands of Philip II of Macedon.  We have always had shaky relations with the Greeks, but now some of our people view their cities as pillars of strength and stability. Will we change with the times or remain true to our nomadic way of life, as we have done for countless generations?"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mission will be considered complete when the Scythian people have chosen to follow our ancestral traditions or fully embrace Hellenic society."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_REWARD_DESCRIPTION:0 "Reform the government and change the social direction of the Scythian tribes."
 #greek_5_pontus_loyalty_reward_tt:0 "Every member of the #Y [gm_family_head_5.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective]#! family will gain #G 10#! Loyalty @loyalty!"
 
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_1:0 "To Be or Not To Be, Greek"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_1_DESC:0 "Our constant trade with the Greek city-states and our close borders have not left the Scythian people unaffected. Foreign influence seems to pervade numerous aspects of our tribal customs. There are rumors of Hellenic rites being performed in the open fields inside tents, and small effigies being built of foreign gods in private."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_2:0 "They Will Join Us"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_2_DESC:0 "Having chosen to accept the Hellenic influence that the Greek cities have on our people, we must now consummate our relationship with them."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_3:0 "Trade Requires Ports"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_3_DESC:0 "If we are going to compete with the Greek cities for trade and power in the sea, we need to show off a great port to receive the merchant ships, and a market where they can sell their goods."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_4:0 "Butting Heads with the Bosporans"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_4_DESC:0 "We have built the foundations of a great port city, and soon a trading empire. However, the Bosporan Kingdom, the current ruler of the wide waves, is an ever-present threat. There is frothing in the water, and tension fills the air..."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_5:0 "Scythoi Pentapolis"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_5_DESC:0 "Huddled huts and wagon trains will not compete with the Greeks. We must trade; we must prosper; we must build cities!"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_6:0 "Abandon the Tribal Ways"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_6_DESC:0 "If we are going to imitate the Greek states, we need to throw off the tribal functions holding us back. The state must be strong and the people must feel both militarily and economically secure in our lands."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_7:0 "Invite the Greeks"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_7_DESC:0 "If we are to learn the Greek ways best, it is best to have models in our own cities."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_8:0 "Embrace Hellenism"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_8_DESC:0 "We have let the Greeks into our daily lives, living in our cities. Now we must let them into our hearts. Let the old ways pass in the wake of the new."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_9:0 "Ancient Ties"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_9_DESC:0 "A long time ago one of our people told the Greeks our greatest story, how our people came to be. Yet, when the Greeks saw the deeds of our gods, they heard the names of their own and so declared their gods at work, Herakles chief among them. They claim that he slept with a creature half woman, half snake, and that their bond created the first among our tribe. Perhaps there is no difference between their version and ours, and if we are to be Greek, let us believe it to be so."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_10:0 "Hold the Euxinos Games"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_10_DESC:0 "Now that we worship the Greek gods, we should announce our presence on the Hellenic stage proudly. Let us, in homage to the Olympian Games, host our own series of challenges for similarly Hellenic nations on the banks of the wide Euxinus."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_11:0 "Crown the Basileus"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_11_DESC:0 "The moment is upon us. We have taken the steps and it has been a long road, but we can now consider ourselves a Hellenic worshipping people, retaining only parts of our nomadic heritage. It is fitting, then, that we should crown amongst ourselves a Greek king, the first Scythian Basileus."

 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_12:0 "They Will Die"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_12_DESC:0 "Our people have spoken and we have refused the Greek ways. Now we must exert control over the region and prove to the outsiders the true strength of the Scythian way!"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_13:0 "Unify The Scythian People"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_13_DESC:0 "Our people must speak with one voice, pray with one hand, and fight riding one horse and letting the poison-tipped arrow fly from one bow. Make it so."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_14:0 "Sacrifice the Greeks"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_14_DESC:0 "We must sacrifice our enemies to the gods, appeasing them and praying for good omens."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_15:0 "They Are Beneath Us"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_15_DESC:0 "The Greeks can only be our enemies now. Let us bait them to foolishly attack our borders so that we may wage war on them freely."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_16:0 "Shouldering The Tyras"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_16_DESC:0 "The Tyras river will make a new border for our people’s domain. Garrisons on our side of the river protect our flanks and our riders may raid with impunity."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_17:0 "The Taurian Cliffs"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_17_DESC:0 "The Tauri have sometimes been confused with us by the Greeks. Perhaps these boat-loving foreigners would be better utilized under our rule?"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_18:0 "They Can Only Be Slaves"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_18_DESC:0 "What is a Bosporan but trouble? Make them selves and they will make us riches."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_19:0 "The Great Horde"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_19_DESC:0 "We have enough capable warriors to amass the great horde. Go, and call on the able-bodied men and women among us."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_20:0 "Unlikely Allies"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_20_DESC:0 "The Bosporans have proved great adversaries in our conquest of the region. We may not be able to fight them alone, so we must find allies."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_21:0 "The Cimmerian Bosporus"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_21_DESC:0 "It is time that we rule all of Taurica! However, the lands across the bosporus fall, let those on this side be ours."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_22:0 "Burn Their Cities"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_22_DESC:0 "Greeks and foreigners will come to fear and dread our Scythian armies. They have operated with arrogance and condecension for too long. We will send a message they shall not soon forget."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_23:0 "A Second Golden Age"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_23_DESC:0 "Across Taurica and Sarmatia, the other tribes and nations have learned to respect our command and fear our armies. Their once proud cities lie wasted while our own capital prospers. We have avenged Ateas's legacy. We are Scythia and we will ride forever!"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_24:0 "The Targitaoan Games"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_24_DESC:0 "Let us strengthen our hegemony over the horse lords of the world. Send out the messengers and call on all the groups near and far to journey over the rolling hills and across the endless plains into our lands to compete in the great Targitaoan Games, in honor of our first father."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_25:0 "Ready The Horse Lords"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_25_DESC:0 "If we are to grow stronger and conquer our enemies, we must build a great, unstoppable horde."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_26:0 "Man The Walls"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_26_DESC:0 "Be them random bands of raiders or an endless horizon of enemies, we must prepare to protect ourselves."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_26:0 "From Our Palms"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_26_DESC:0 "In order to supply our great horde, we need to produce more food. The lands between the Great Sea and the steppe are fertile. Our fields will be plowed by those who cannot ride and by our many slaves."
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_27:0 "Luxuries Are Necessities"
 scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_27_DESC:0 "In order to maintain our expansion we’ll need more money. Purchase the Greek and neighboring peoples’ wares, and bring trade into our ports."


### MISSION EVENTS
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.1.t:1 "$01_scythia_missions_01_greek_stance$: Crisis of Identity"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.desc:0 "We have always had a strong connection with the Greek cities on the coast of the Pontos Euxinos, for good and bad. We cannot pretend that this relationship has not affected our way of life, the lives of our very own people. But now is the time when we decide where we stand - who we are."

 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.4.t:0 "$scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_1$: Black Sea Slave Trade"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.4.desc:0 "With our economy suffering, we must rely on foreign trade to bring in new wealth. The Greeks have always required two things of us; food and slaves. The latter in particular is a lucrative business. Perhaps a few more slaves here and there will open some trade doors for us..."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.4.a:0 "Yes, the coin is what counts, no matter where it comes from..."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.4.at:0 "Up to #Y 5# Slave Pops will move to various greek nations. #Y Scythia# will gain gold for each slave sold. #Y 2# Hellenic Bosporain #Y Nobles# appear in [SCOPE.province('Capital').GetName]"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.4.b:0 "No. The Greeks have done us harm enough and deserve nothing from our lands. Curse their ill-gotten coin."

 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.5.t:0 "$scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_1$: Bacchic Rites"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.5.desc:0 "There were rumours that some of our people scurried to Olbian territory during the night to perform some sacrilegious Hellenic rite. That was before - now our people openly disrespect the old ways; bands of men and women brazenly travel over to the Greek city in broad daylight in order to make offerings. What is to be done?"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.5.a:0 "The will of the people wishes this, and it is too many of them to argue against. Let them go."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.5.at:0 "Up to #Y 3# Heptadic Citizen Pops convert to #Y Hellenism# and will move to the territory of #Y Ektonopolis#. #Y Ektonopolis# will gain #Y Religious Partners# for #Y 120# months."

 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.t:0 "$scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_1$: Heraklean Targitaos"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.desc:0 "Our magistrate, [SCOPE.character('Magistrate').GetName], was going about his duties collecting tribute from all the people under your rule when it was getting late and he noticed a train of people walking into the woods. There he found a shrine, not one built for our gods, but a Greek perversion of beloved Targitaos. What should be done?"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.a:0 "It is clear that our people wish to embrace the Greek way of life, though they still honor our old gods as well. Perhaps the old ways can find new meanings."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.at:0 "The #Y Hellenic# deity #Y Heraklean Targitaos# is now available. A #Y Holy Site# to #Y Heraklean Targitaos# is built in the territory of #Y Uttar#. #Y Uttar# will gain #Y New Religious Cult#."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.b:0 "Send a band of riders at daybreak - tell them to take everything of value and burn the rest to the ground. We cannot allow this destruction of our way of life."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.6.bt:0 "The territory of #Y Uttar# will gain #Y Agitated Local Priesthood# for #Y 120# months."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.t:0 "$scythia_mission_01_greek_stance_task_2$: Bonds With Tyras"
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.desc:0 "Ah, Tyras, the bigger brother of Nikonion, a great port before its name-sake river. We have often ignored this Greek city in our past disdain of the Greeks. But it is a new day, and we must seek better relations with them in order to access the wealth that travels along that watery road."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.a:0 "We will see these new friends as allies, and rejoice in our equally beneficial arrangement."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.at:0 "#Y Tyras# will gain #G +100# opinion of #Y Scythia#. #Y Tyras# may becomes an #Y Ally#."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.b:0 "We see them as friends, but we can not bow down to their level. In order to climb the ladder of this new, Greek world we must guide the weak. It will just take some...negotiations."
 me_scythia_01_greek_stance.10.bt:0 ""#Y Scythia# will lose #R 200# gold. #Y Tyras# will gain #G +100# opinion of #Y Scythia#. #Y Tyras# may becomes a #Y Client State#."
