  bactria_bactrian_heartland_DESCRIPTION:0 "Our satrapy remains under the iron grip of the Seleukid Empire, which has become pre-occupied with numerous conflicts to the West. As the Seleukids attempt to lay claim to the lands of Syria and Anatolia, they have left us to languish, unable to defend our lands from the barbarian hordes of Scythia. Bactria is wealthy, urbanized and fertile, and could become a great nation in its own right, however this can only be done by freeing ourselves from the grip of the Seleukid Empire once and for all. We will then build our nation into a thriving empire, centered on our Bactrian heartland."
  bactria_bactrian_heartand_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete after we continued our Urbanization efforts, aswell as consolidating our Political Apparatus."
  bactria_bactrian_heartland_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Our Bactrian heartland is fed by the Oxus and Jaxartes rivers, allowing us to grow ample food. Our cities are large and prosperous, and our key trade routes have opened us up to the wealth of India and Serica. We must invest heavily in our heartland, and in turn transform it into one of the most powerful Hellenistic states."
